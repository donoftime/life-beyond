# Life Beyond

~Improving the quality of Life Clerics~

Improving the quality of life _for_ Life Clerics when using the amazing D&D Beyond app. This is a simple
chrome extension which adds hints to your spell book to remind you about how the Life Domain class features
work. Specifically, it calculates the bonuses for _Disciple of Life_ and _Blessed Healer_ then gives a short
explanation next to the heal summary for every healing spell.

This will certainly be done better when this ticket is implemented:

In the meantime, this chrome extension will hopefully fill the gap.
